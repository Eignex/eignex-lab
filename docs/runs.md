# Usage

[Setup](../deploy/SETUP.md) · [Complete command list](../deploy/lab)

## Experiments

Submit one experiment per question. Save this as `experiment.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "restarts-ab",
  "description": "Compare restart policies",
  "problems": {"suite": "xcsp3-cop", "max": "20"},
  "base": {"ref": "main", "engine": "cp", "timeout": "30000"},
  "grid": {"param.restarts": ["luby", "geometric"]}
}
```

```sh
deploy/lab run experiment.json
deploy/lab show 7
deploy/lab cases 7
deploy/lab fetch 7
```

Replace `7` with the returned ID. `base` supplies shared arm values; `configs` overrides them and `grid` crosses
combinations. Timeouts are milliseconds. The lab queues and places work automatically.

## Koblas and profiles

Only committed code in Eignex repositories runs, from `main` or trusted branches. Profiles default to ten minutes,
capped at two hours; `--timeout` uses seconds. Scripts own their instrumentation; JVM mains record JFR.

```sh
deploy/lab koblas main "Dot smoke capture" --smoke --operation dot

deploy/lab profile --repo Eignex/eignex-lab --build installDist \
  --classpath 'build/install/eignex-lab/lib/*' --timeout 600 \
  com.eignex.lab.MainKt main "Startup capture" -- check
```

## Optional controls

Most jobs omit hardware and recording options:

```sh
deploy/lab run --tags 'arch:x86_64,simd:avx2,!spot' --measurement jfr experiment.json
```

`--tags` requires comma-separated labels; `!` excludes one. Detected architecture/SIMD tags and custom node labels
are supported. Capability tags do not prove which instructions a benchmark executed.

The **Nodes** tab shows the local machine, cloud pools, active nodes, and their allocations. To start a specific
kind of cloud node, select its configured pool by CPU, memory, architecture/SIMD tags, and Spot or on-demand market.
Choose the minimum total nodes to keep in that pool and a duration of 15–60 minutes. Existing nodes count toward
the minimum; requests respect the pool and global vCPU limits. Release a request to return that capacity to
automatic scaling, which retires idle nodes after its normal delay. Additional node shapes need a configured pool.
Each node shows one CPU architecture and primary SIMD profile, such as `x86_64 / AVX-512` or `ARM64 / SME2`.
Detected lower instruction sets remain compatibility capabilities. For AVX2-only placement, require `simd:avx2`
and exclude `simd:avx512`; for NEON-only placement, exclude `simd:sve` and `simd:sme` as well.

`measurement` modes are `none` (default), `resources`, `jfr`, `compilation`, and `compilation+log`.
Recording modes default to serial execution and require `parallel: 1`.

Set `param.source-validation=true` in `base` for external witness checking. A checked witness does not certify
optimality. Only an invalid verdict withdraws the solver's claim; unsupported or failed checks leave it unchecked.
